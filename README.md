## Configure `gMod`

By default, only `Borderless_Cartography_Made_Easy_2015_1.3.tpf` is loaded.

If you want to load the `Minimalus_UI_v2.1.tpf`, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Go to your installation directory, usually:

    - `/home/your-username/Games/guild-wars-enhanced`
    - `$HOME/Games/guild-wars-enhanced`

    You can also Right Click on the game in Lutris and select **Browse Files**.

2. Navigate to `drive_c/gMod`
3. Open `modlist.txt` in a text editor
4. Add `C:\gMod\Minimalus_UI_v2.1.tpf` to the file
5. Save the file
6. You can now launch the game with one of the launchers that enables gMod

> [!NOTE]
> You can load more mods by adding their `.tpf` files to the `gMod` directory and updating the `modlist.txt` file accordingly.
